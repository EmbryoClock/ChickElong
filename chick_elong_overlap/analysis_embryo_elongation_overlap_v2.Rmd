### 4. Functions to calculate overlap between HHStages

**Goal:** Calculate the pairwise overlap between measurement distributions.

**Overview of the approach**

The idea is to calculate the integral of the minimum of the two density functions over the range where both have nonzero density. This provides a straightforward measure of similarity between two distributions, and therefore an intuitive way to quantify the overlap between the ridge plots (or kernel density estimates).

**Simple Overlap Calculation**

  1. Estimate Kernel Density: Compute the density estimates for both distributions using the same grid of points.
  2. Find the Intersection: At each grid point, take the minimum value of the two density functions.
  3. Integrate the Intersection: Sum (or integrate) these minimum density values across the grid to obtain the overlap score.

Mathematically:

  `Overlap = âˆ« min(f1(x), f2(x)) dx`

where f1(x) and f2(x) are the density functions of the two distributions.

**Why This Works**

  1. The approach is scale-invariant (not affected by total number of observations).
  2. It gives an intuitive measure where 0 means no overlap and 1 means complete overlap (if densities are normalized).
  3. It does not require complex statistics, just basic density estimation and summation.
